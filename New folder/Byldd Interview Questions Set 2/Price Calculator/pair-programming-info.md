Here are some more details: 

1. We'll be pairing, though you'll be doing most of the driving. Think of us as collaborators. I am here to answer questions about the problem and the solution.
2. I am trying to assess how well you solve problems so show me what you're doing!
3. Googling things is fine.
4. The problem evolves through a series of steps. It's not a race though we want to make progress. Also, let's not skip ahead, even if you think you know the next answer.
5. Make sure you have your system all set up including having NodeJS, NPM and an editor installed. The exercise won't require any sort of web interface or GUI, so just stick to the basics.
6. You will be writing some tests with Mocha.
