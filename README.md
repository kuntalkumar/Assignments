In the context of Redux, a dispatcher is not a separate entity but refers to the **`dispatch`** function provided by the Redux store. The **`dispatch`** function is a fundamental part of Redux and is used to dispatch actions to the store, triggering the state change.

Here's a brief explanation of how the dispatcher works in Redux:

1. **Dispatching an Action:**
    - When you want to update the state in a Redux application, you create an action using an action creator.
    - The action is a plain JavaScript object that typically has a **`type`** property describing the action and may include a **`payload`** for additional data.
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    const addTodoAction = {
      type: 'ADD_TODO',
      payload: {
        text: 'Buy groceries',
      },
    };
    
    ```
    
2. **Dispatching the Action:**
    - To actually make the state change, you use the **`dispatch`** function provided by the Redux store.
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    store.dispatch(addTodoAction);
    
    ```
    
    - The **`dispatch`** function takes the action object as an argument and sends it to the Redux store.
3. **Reducer Handles the Action:**
    - The Redux store is associated with one or more reducers, which are pure functions responsible for handling specific types of actions.
    - When an action is dispatched, the store passes the current state and the action to the reducers.
4. **State Update:**
    - The reducer processes the action and returns a new state based on the changes described in the action.
5. **Subscribers Notified:**
    - Once the state is updated, the store notifies all subscribed components, and they can re-render based on the updated state.

Here's a simplified example:

```jsx
javascriptCopy code
// Action Creator
const addTodo = (text) => ({
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  payload: { text },
});

// Dispatching the Action
store.dispatch(addTodo('Buy groceries'));

```

In this example, **`store.dispatch(addTodo('Buy groceries'))`** dispatches the **`addTodo`** action to the Redux store, initiating the process of updating the state based on the action.
